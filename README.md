# LaptopPricePrediction

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various specifications such as processor type, RAM, storage, screen size, and other features using Machine Learning models.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about various laptop models, their specifications, and their respective prices.

Features include:

Brand

Processor Type

RAM Size

Storage Type & Capacity

Screen Size & Resolution

Operating System

Price (Target Variable)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy (Data Handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Models)

Streamlit (For Web Deployment)

📌 Steps Involved

Data Collection & Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.

Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.

Model Selection & Training:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Ada boost Regressor

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance.

Evaluation: Using R², and MAE to measure accuracy.

Deployment: Creating a Streamlit web app for user interaction.

📈 Results & Insights

The Extra Tree model achieved the highest accuracy with an R² score of 85.53 and Random Forest model achieve 85.43 accuracy.
 
Feature importance analysis showed that Processor RAM, ppi and SSD are key price predictors.

🎯 Future Scope

Expand the dataset with more brands and models.

Improve model accuracy using deep learning techniques.

Deploy the model as an API for real-time predictions.
